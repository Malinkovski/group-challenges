      // Exercise I:
      // Make a JavaScript program that will check whether the time is AM or PM (US time). Now, do not enter the full time, but only the hours as a number. (i.e. 10)
      // You will have to get and save the hours from prompt (hint: prompt(‘enter hours’).)
      // If it’s AM, show in console “It’s {time}AM”. (i.e “It’s 10AM”) , and accordingly for the PM too.
      // Make sure you check the exception when the user enters an hour bigger than 24, or a simple text. If that happens, just show in the console “You’ve entered a wrong number for hour”.
      // Additionally: there’s an img folder sent along the starter files, which has 2 images.
      // Make another check and see if the same hours from above are daytime or nighttime.
      // Daytime is the following hours (6h - 17h)
      // Nighttime is the following hours (18h - 6h)
      // If the hours are in the daytime period, show the sun image in HTML, and if the hours are in the nighttime period, show the moon image in HTML.
      // You will have to create the image, fill it’s source and append/attach it to the body dynamically in JavaScript. Don’t just add <img> tags in your html and hide/show them with css.
      let hour = +window.prompt("Enter hours");
      let AM_PM = "AM";
      if (isNaN(hour)) {
        window.alert("Please enter only a numbers for hours.");
      } else if (hour < 0 || hour > 23) {
        window.alert("You have entered a wrong number for hours.");
      } else {
        const time = hour;
        if (hour > 11) {
          AM_PM = "PM";
          hour -= 12;
        }
        if (hour === 0) {
          hour = 12;
        }
        window.alert(`it's ${hour} ${AM_PM}`);
        Daytime = time >= 6 && time <= 17; // boolean for daytime

        const img = document.createElement("img");
        img.src = Daytime ? "img/sun.png" : "img/moon.png";
        document.body.appendChild(img);
